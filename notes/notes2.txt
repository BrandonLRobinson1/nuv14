react-native link react-native-vector-icons --> try in new branch for driod fix

//// debugger wont run on driod

n my case the issue was that the emulator was making a request to:

http://10.0.2.2:8081/debugger-ui

instead of:

http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui and the request was failing.






Now run 🔥react-devtools from the terminal to launch the standalone DevTools app:








I want to automatically get the title of the previous scene on the current scene and display the return title in the upper left corner of the current scene.

@lucasleelz Easy, just pass the title of the current scene to the next scene.
For example in your current scene of which you want to show the title of on the nextScene:
`Actions.nextScene({title: this.props.title})`

And in your nextScene (or whatever name you have), just use:

```
componentDidMount(){
Actions.refresh({backTitle: ()=> this.props.title})
}
```
Should do the job, obviously you can play around and have the title in the redux store if you use it, and or fire Actions.refresh in a different place for example when you get a response from the api or something.

Hope this helps, hit that thumbs up button 👍
